This insight shows a list of users in a segment and lets you view the
latest events and properties for each user.

With no segments selected, all users found in the data will be
listed. Click rows to expand them and see detailed information about
an individual user.

When a segment is selected, the list is filtered to only show users
from that segment.

**Example:** See latest events at a glance for your *Most active*
users by creating the segment in
[Activity Distribution](/explore/bitdeli/activity-distribution)
and opening this insight with the segment selected.
